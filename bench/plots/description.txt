## Traversal directions ##

### bu "bottom-up" ###
fully resolve each argument before attempting to resolve a function call

### td "top-down" ###
resolve arguments filtered to match types allowed by function parameters (cached to avoid duplication of work)

## Assertion resolution orders ##

### def "deferred" ###
optimistically assume all assertions resolvable, only resolve assertions for cheapest top-level interpretations once all top-level interpretations are generated

### imm "immediate" ###
resolve assertions immediately after generating interpretation (disambiguation deferred as in def)

### top "top-level" ###
resolve assertions when each top-level interpretation is generated
